# PokeInventory

## How to run:
1. Navigate to the /Builds directory
2. Download the .zip file for your operating system
3. Unzip the file to a local directory
4. In the /Publish directory, run PokeInventory.exe
    *	If you are a unix user (I only included a single Ubuntu build...) you may need to run chmod 700 on the PokeInventory.exe before running

## My operating system wasn't included in /Builds, what now?

Please let me know! I can push the build for any OS in the .NETCore RID catalog:
